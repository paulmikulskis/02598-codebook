Data Collection Description

The Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 1997, is comprised of two
distinct surveys. Both surveys used the same data collection instument, and data files resulting
from the combination of the two have the same variables and record layout. The 1997 Survey of
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF) was conducted for the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) by the Bureau of the Census. The 1997 Survey of Inmates in Federal
Correctional Facilities (SIFCF) was also conducted for the BJS and the Federal Bureau of Prisons
(BOP) by the Bureau of the Census. These surveys provide nationally representative data on
State prison inmates and sentenced Federal inmates held in Federally owned and operated
facilities. Through personal interviews from June through October, 1997, inmates in both State
and Federal prisons provided information about their current offense and sentence, criminal
history, family background and personal characteristics, prior drug and alcohol use and treatment
programs, gun possession and use, and prison activities, programs and services. Prior surveys of
State prison inmates were conducted in 1974, 1979, 1986, and 1991. Sentenced Federal prison
inmates were first interviewed in the 1991 survey. For the year 1997, data collected for the State
and Federal surveys were combined into one file. Variable V1959 indicates the type of prison in
which the respondent was incarcerated.


Sample Design

The sample of inmates for the 1997 SISCF was selected from a universe of 1,409 state prisons
which were enumerated in the BJS 1995 Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities or
had opened between completion of the Census and June 30, 1996. The sample for the SIFCF
was selected from the BOP=s list of 127 federally owned and operated facilities holding
sentenced inmates on June 30, 1996. The sample design for both surveys was a stratified two-
stage selection; first selecting prisons, and second, selecting inmates in sampled prisons (see
tables 1 and 2).

1.      First Stage of Sample Design

For both the State and Federal inmate surveys, correctional facilities were separated into two
sampling frames: one for prisons with male inmates and one for prisons with female inmates.


                                                                                                  Page 3
Prisons holding both sexes were included in both lists and treated independently in sample
selection based upon either their relevant male or female population.

The State prison universe included 1,131 prisons with only male inmates, 131 with only female
inmates, and 147 with both male and female inmates. Consequently there were 1,278 prisons on
the male facility list and 278 prisons on the female facility list. Of these facilities, 280 State
prisons were selected for the sample, including 220 male facilities and 60 female facilities. In
addition, 20 facilities were selected in two independent reserve samples of 10 each, to be visited
for interviews only in the event that more than 10 prisons in the original sample refused to
participate.

In the sampling of State facilities, the 13 largest male prisons and the 17 largest female prisons
were selected with certainty and designated as Aself-representing.@ The remaining 1,265 male
prisons and 261 female prisons were each grouped into 7 strata, defined by census region
(Northeast except New York, New York, Midwest, South except Texas, Texas, West except
California, and California). Within each stratum facilities were ordered by facility type
(confinement or community-based), security level (maximum, medium, minimum and none), and
size of population, ordered from low to high within each category. From this list 223 male and
47 female prisons were selected, based on probability proportional to size, that is, the higher the
number of inmates in a prison, the higher the probability of being selected. In addition, 16 male
facilities and 4 female facilities were selected for the reserve sample, but were not used.

The Federal prison universe included 105 prisons with only male inmates, 14 with only female
inmates and 8 with inmates of both sexes; thus there were 113 male facilities and 22 female
facilities. The first stage sample included 32 male facilities and 8 female facilities.

For the Federal sample one male and two female facilities were selected with certainty. The
remaining male prisons were grouped into 5 strata, based on security level (administrative, high,
medium, low, and minimum); similarly, the remaining female prisons were grouped into two
strata based on security level (minimum and other security levels, including administrative, high,
and low). Within each stratum, facilities were ordered by size of population from low to high in
each category and selected with probability proportional to size.

Systematic samples of State and Federal facilities were selected within each stratum using a
random start and a sampling interval. Before selecting the sample in each stratum, the number of
facilities to be sampled in the stratum was determined and this number was used to calculate the
sampling interval. The number of facilities to be selected without certainty in a stratum was
determined by dividing the total population of either males or females in non-self-representing
prisons in a stratum by the total population of either males or females in all non-self-representing
prisons. The sampling interval within each stratum was then calculated by dividing the male or
female non-self-representing population by the desired number of sample prisons. The random
start is a random value between 0 and the sampling interval. At least 2 non-self-representing
Page 4
facilities were selected in each stratum to allow for within-stratum variance calculations.

Of the 280 prisons initially selected for the SISCF, two female facilities had closed before
interviewing and 3 female facilities refused to participate. All 40 sampled Federal facilities
participated.

2.     Second Stage of Sample Design

In the second stage of sample selection, inmates were selected for interviewing. From a list
provided by the facility, interviewers in State prisons selected the sample from all inmates using
a bed the previous night. After numbering the list, interviewers entered the total number of
inmates on the list into their computers. Using computerized procedures, including a randomly
selected starting point and a determined skip interval, the computer provided numbers of inmates
selected for interview corresponding to the numbers entered by the interviewers on the facility
list. The total number selected for interview was based upon the size of the facility and gender of
inmates housed there. In the SISCF 12,269 males and 3,116 females were sampled, excluding
those ineligible for participation and allowing for about 10% nonresponse.

For Federal facilities BOP research staff selected the sample from their cental list and provided it
to the facility the week interviewers were scheduled to start. The second stage sample was
drawn in two steps, so that nondrug offenders, who were 41% of males in Federal prisons and
32% of females, would be included in the samples in large enough numbers to be analyzed. In
the first step 5,854 males and 1,875 females were selected, using a random start and
predetermined sampling interval. In the second step, 1 in every 3 drug offenders was selected
from the first set, together with all the nondrug offenders. Thus, 3,525 males and 954 females
were sampled, excluding those ineligible for participation and allowing for a 10% nonresponse.

As a result approximately 1 in every 75 males and 1 in every 17 females in State facilities were
selected in the State survey and 1 in every 13 males and 1 in every 3 females selected in the
Federal survey. A total of 14,285 interviews were completed for the State survey and 4,041 for
the Federal survey

The interview, about an hour in length, used computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI).
With CAPI, computers provide questions for the interviewer, including follow-up questions
tailored to preceding answers. Before the interview, inmates were told verbally and in writing
that participation was voluntary and that all information provided would be held in confidence.
Participants were assured that the survey was solely for statistical purposes and that no
individual who participated would be identified in survey results.




                                                                                                 Page 5
Estimation Procedures

The estimation procedures for the SISCF and SIFCF involved weighting the responses from the sampled,
interviewed inmates to produce estimates with some calculable degree of sampling error. A series of
adjustment factors were applied to the basic weight of each interviewed inmate. Weights for Federal and
State inmates were calculated separately.

A. Basic weight (BW).

The initial weight, or basic weight, for each sampled inmate is the inverse of the probability of selection.
For the SISCF, this was 74.6869 for males, and 17.4329 for females. For the SISCF, this was 13.1815 for
males, and 3.0747 for females.

B. Drug Subsampling Factor (DSSF)

The Drug Subsampling Factor was calculated for the SIFCF only. To compensate for subsampling drug
offenders by taking only a third of those originally selected, in this adjustment drug offenders were
multiplied by 3 and nondrug offenders by 1.

C. Weighting Control Factor (WCF)

In some prisons, the sampling rate for a facility was adjusted because the actual number of persons in a
prison on the sampling date was different from the expected number from the 1995 Census of State and
Federal Correctional Facilities or the 1996 list from the BOP. When the actual number was less than 80%
or more than 120% of the expected number, the weighting control factor was applied to account for
adjusting the inmate sampling rate. The weighting control factor is equal to the number of inmates in a
facility on the interview date divided by the number expected for that facility. If the expected number was
within 20% of the expected number, the weighting control factor was 1.

D. Duplication Control Factor (DCF)

Several of the very smallest prisons have a total inmate population that is smaller than the number to be
sampled in each facility in a particular stratum. For example, if a sample prison contained 15 inmates in a
stratum in which 55 were expected to be interviewed, there would be a shortage of inmates. The DCF is
used to adjust for the workload shortfall in such prisons. It is equal to the expected number of sample
inmates in each facility in a stratum divided by the number of inmates in the prison on the date of the
sample. In most prisons, the calculated DCF is less than one because the prison had more total inmates
than the expected number in the sample for that stratum; in this case the DCF is set to 1.

E. Noninterview Factor (NIF)

This factor was applied to adjust the weights to account for noninterviewed inmates. The NIF was
calculated as follows:

-      Basic demographic data on noninterviewed inmates were obtained by interviewers from prison
records after they completed interviewing in a facility for the SISCF or from BOP for SIFCF.

-     Inmate records, including noninterviewed inmates, were separated by gender, stratum, race (Black,
nonBlack), and age (tables 3-6).

-       If there were fewer than 30 unweighted cases in a cell, it was collapsed with those in the nearest
age category (see tables 3-6).

-       For each cell in tables 3-6, the adjusted weights (BW x WCF x DCF) were summed separately for
interviewed inmates (I) and for noninterviewed inmates (N).

-       A noninterview adjustment factor was calculated for each cell as the sum of the adjusted weights
(BW x WCF x DCF) for both interviewed and noninterviewed inmates divided by the adjusted weights for
the interviewed, or NIF=(I + N)/I.

F. Offense Category Ratio Adjustment Factor (OCRAF)

 The OCRAF was used to adjust the weighted sample to reflect varying interview rates among
inmates in different offense categories. The OCRAF was computed separately for males and
females for 22 different offense categories for State inmates (see table 7) and for 14 offense
categories for Federal inmates (see table 8). It was calculated as the weighted count of interview
and noninterview thru the DCF divided by the weighted count for each stratum through
application of the NIF.

G. Control Count Ratio Adjustment Factor (CCRAF)

The CCRAF adjusts the weighted interviews by stratum level counts as of June 30, 1997. For
the SISCF these counts were from the National Prisoners Statistics series (NPS-1A). For the
SIFCF, the BOP provided counts of sentenced Federal prisoners as of June 30, 1997 (See tables
9 and 10).

Accuracy of the Estimates

Since the SISCF and SIFCF estimates come from a sample, they may differ from figures from a
complete census using the same questionnaire, instructions, and enumerators. A sample survey
has two possible types of errors: sampling and nonsampling. The accuracy of an estimate
depends on both types of errors, but the full extent of the nonsampling error is unknown.
Consequently, one should be particularly careful when interpreting results based on a relatively
small number of cases or small differences between estimates. The standard errors for SISCF and
SIFCF estimates primarily indicate the magnitude of sampling error. They also partially measure
the effect of some nonsampling errors in responses and enumeration, but do not measure
systematic biases in the data. (Bias is the average over all possible samples of the differences
between the sample estimates and the desired value.)

1.     Nonsampling variability

There are several sources of nonsampling errors, including the following:

       -       Inability to obtain information about all cases in the sample
       -       Definition difficulties
       -       Differences in the interpretation of questions
       -       Respondents= inability or unwillingness to provide correct information.
       -       Respondents= inability to recall information
       -       Errors made in data collection such as in recording or coding the data
       -       Errors made in processing the data
       -       Errors made in estimating values for missing data
       -       Failure to represent all units within the sample.

2.     Nonresponse

Nonresponse in the SISCF and SIFCF resulted from failing to obtain cooperation with sample
prisons (first stage nonresponse) or failing to obtain completed interviews with sampled inmates
(second stage). In the weighting of the sample, the NIF adjusted the weights for second stage

                                                                                         Page 15
nonresponse. The NIF was calculated based on gender, race, age and stratum. However, biases
exist in the estimates to the extent that noninterviewed inmates have different characteristics from
those of interviewed inmates in the same age-gender-ethnicity-stratum group. For the SISCF the
CCRAF adjusted for the shortfall of interviews resulting from the loss of the 3 prisons which
refused to participate. There was no first-stage nonresponse in the SIFCF since all 40 sampled
SIFCF prisons participated in the survey.

In the second stage, nonresponse resulted from failing to obtain completed interviews with
sampled inmates. A total of 1,100 inmates in the State survey and 438 in the Federal survey
refused to participate, resulting in 7.2% second stage nonresponse among State inmates and 9.8%
among Federal inmates (Table 11).

Total nonresponse for each survey includes both first and second stage nonresponse. If the 106
expected interviews in the 3 State facilities which refused to participate is included with the
1,100 second stage refusals, nonresponse for the SISCF is 7.8%. Nonresponse for the SIFCF
remains 9.8% since all Federal facilities participated.

  Federal sample refused to participate.

3.     Comparability of data

Data obtained from the SISCF and SIFCF are not entirely comparable with data from other
sources. This is due to differences in interviewer training and experience and in differing survey
processes. This is an example of nonsampling variability not reflected in the standard errors.
Caution should be used when comparing results from different sources.

Page 16
Note on results based upon a small number of cases or small differences in estimates: When
summary measures (such as medians and percent distributions) are computed on a base smaller
than 5,000 for the SISCF and 1,000 for SIFCF, they probably do not reveal useful information
because of the large standard errors involved. In addition, nonsampling errors may result in small
differences which may appear to be borderline significant, but are not really different.

4.     Sampling variability

Sampling variability is variation that occurred by chance because a sample was surveyed rather
than the entire population. Standard errors are primarily measures of sampling variability,
although they may include some nonsampling error. They are measures of the variations that
occur by chance because a sample rather than the entire population was surveyed. The sample
estimate and its standard error enable one to construct a confidence interval, a range that would
include the average result for all possible samples with a known probability. For example, if all
possible samples were surveyed under essentially the same general conditions and using the same
sample design, and if an estimate and its standard error were calculated from each sample, then
approximately 95% of the intervals from 1.96 standard errors below the estimate to 1.96
standard errors above the estimate would include the average result of all possible samples. A
particular confidence interval may or may not contain the average estimate derived from all
possible samples. However, one can say with specified confidence that the interval includes the
average estimate calculated from all possible samples. Standard errors may also be used to
perform hypothesis testing.

5.     Generalized variance estimates

A number of approximations are required to derive, at a moderate cost, standard errors applicable
to estimates from these two surveys. Instead of providing an individual standard error for each
estimate, two parameters, a and b, are provided to calculate standard errors for each type of
characteristic (see tables 12 and 13 ).

Variances were calculated using Vplex, a Bureau of the Census software package designed to
calculate variances for data derived from multistage complex sample designs. Variances were
calculated for the total sample and for gender, marital status and race/ethnicity subgroups (male
or female, and black, nonblack, or Hispanic and married or single). Variables for which variances
were estimated included criminal justice status, prior sentence to incarceration, prior sentence to
probation, current offense (murder or manslaughter, sexual offense, assault, robbery, other
violent, drug offense), marital status, ever used marijuana, ever used cocaine or crack, alcohol use,
armed during crime, HIV status, military service, one or more victims, education, age (not used
for SIFCF), monthly income prior to arrest, whether physically or sexually abused, family
member ever in prison, employment status at arrest, sentenced status, whether under the
influence of drugs at time of arrest, whether under the influence of alcohol at time of arrest,

                                                                                             Page 17
whether maximum sentence was less or more than 5 years, whether a disability, whether had
children, whether received help for a mental or emotional problem, who lived with growing up.
These variances were calculated for the general form 2 = ax 2 + bx The variances were then
transformed logrythmically and plotted in a regression in several iterations, excluding outliers
until a best fit was obtained. Hence, the a values are the intercept and the b values the slope of
the line.

Tests may be performed at various levels of significance. A significance level is the probability
of concluding that the characteristics are different when, in fact, they are the same. To conclude
that two parameters are different at the .05 level of significance, for example, the absolute value
of the estimated difference between characteristics must be greater than or equal to 1.96 times the
standard error of the difference.

       1.      Standard errors of estimated numbers using generalized variance estimates

The approximate standard error, s x, of an estimated number from this survey can be obtained
using the formula:



                                                                                            Page 19
                       2
       (1)     s x = ax + bx

Here x is the size of the estimate and a and b are the parameters in tables 12 and 13 associated
with the particular type of characteristic. When calculating standard errors from cross-
tabulations involving different characteristics, use the set of parameters for the characteristic
which will give the largest standard error.

       Illustration:

According to the SISCF, there were 204,380 male State prison inmates aged 18-24. Using the
appropriate formula (1) and the parameters from table 12, the standard error is calculated where

Number, x                                       204,380
Parameter a                                   -0.000132
Parameter b                                     131.119
Standard error, s x                                4613
95% confidence interval              195,338 to 213,422


                                          2
                s x = - .000132 x 204, 380 + 131.119 x 204,380 = 4,613

The 95% confidence level for male State prison inmates aged 18-24 is calculated as
 240,380 ± (1.96x4,613) or 195,338 to 213,422. A conclusion that the average estimate derived
from all possible samples lies within a range computed in this way would be correct for roughly
95% of all possible samples.

       Illustration:

According to the SIFCF, there were 27,000 Federal prison inmates who were married. Using the
appropriate parameters from table 13 and formula (1) where

Number, x                                  27,000
Parameter a                            -0.000435
Parameter b                                38.776
Standard error, s x                           854
95% confidence interval          25,326 to 28,674

                                        2
                s x = - .000435 x 27,000 + 38.776 x 27,000 = 854.3

The 95% confidence level for Federal prison inmates who are married is calculated as
27,000 ± (1.96x854) or 25,326 to 28,674. A conclusion that the average estimate derived from


Page 20
all possible samples lies within a range computed in this way would be correct for roughly 95%
of all possible samples.

       2.      Standard errors of estimated percentages using generalized variance estimates:

The reliability of an estimated percentage, computed using sample data for both numerator and
denominator, depends on the size of the percentage and its base. Estimated percentages are
relatively more reliable than the corresponding number estimates, particularly if the percentages
are around 50%.

The approximate standard error of an estimated percentage, sx,p, can be obtained by using the
formula


                           b
       (2)     s x, p =      p(100 - p)
                           x

Here x is the total number of inmates, p is the percentage (0 ≤ p ≤ 100) , and b is the parameter in
table 12 or table 13 associated with the characteristic in the numerator of the percentage.

       Illustration:

According to the SISCF, 15.4% of female State prison inmates are Hispanic. Using the
appropriate b parameter from table 12, the standard error is calculated where

Percentage, p                                     15.4
Base, x                                        66,240
Parameter b                                    58.132
95% confidence interval                   13.3 to 17.5




                           58.132
                s x, p =          15.4(100 - 15.4) = 1.1
                           66,240


The 95% confidence interval for the estimated percentage of Hispanic female State prison
inmates is calculated as 15.4 ± 1.96(1.1) , or 13.3% to 17.5%.

       3.      Standard error of the difference using generalized variance estimates:




                                                                                              Page 21
The approximate standard error of an estimated difference, sx-y, can be obtained by using the
formula

        (3)     s x- y = s 2 x + s 2 y

where Sx and Sy are the standard errors of the estimates, x and y. The estimates can be numbers,
percentages, ratios, etc. This represents the actual standard error quite accurately for the
difference between estimates of the same characteristic in two different samples, or for the
difference between separate and uncorrelated characteristics in the same sample. However, if
there is a high correlation between the two characteristics, formula (3) will overestimate the true
standard error.

Illustration:

According to the SIFCF, 29.9% of Federal prison inmates are white nonHispanic; according to
the SISCF, 33.3% of State prison inmates are white, nonHispanic. The apparent difference in the
percentages is 3.4% Using the appropriate parameters from tables 12 and 13 and formulas (2)
and (3), where

                                                    x            y      Difference
Percentage, p                                    29.9         33.3             3.4
Base                                          89,072    1,059,607
Parameter b                                   61.282      173.687
Standard error                                    1.2          0.6             1.34
95% confidence interval                  27.5 to 32.3 32.1 to 34.5       0.8 to 6.0

The standard error of the difference is calculated as

                              2    2
                s x - y = 1. 2 + .6 = 1.34

The 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference in the percentage of Federal and State
prison inmates who are white nonHispanic is calculated as 3.4 ± 1.96(1.34) , or .8 to 6.0. Since
this interval does not include zero, it can be concluded with 95% confidence that the proportions
of white nonHispanic inmates in Federal and State prisons are actually different.

6.      Specific variance estimates

Standard error estimates for specific variables can be derived using software packages developed
to generate standard errors for data obtained from a complex sample survey design. Variables
have been added to the data files to be used in running such software packages. Variables v2068
through v2079 give sample and universe information: v2068 and v2069 give total numbers of


Page 22
males and females in the universe; v2070 and v2071, total numbers of males and females within
stratum; v2074 and v2075, total numbers of males and females within each sampled prison;
V2076 and v2077, the number of males and females interviewed within each sampled prison; and
v2078 and v2079, the total number of prisons in the universe within each stratum. In addition,
v2048 gives the stratum, v2050 and v2051, the male and female population according to the
universe file, and v2047 the number of inmates sampled.


ICPSR Processing Information

General Procedures

This data collection was processed according to standard ICPSR procedures. The data were
checked for wild codes, and when found these were corrected. Missing values were standardized
by the data producer. Standard ICPSR documentation has been prepared for this collection.

Variable Labels and Code Descriptors

ICPSR has edited variable labels and code labels to be within the length limits set by statistical
software packages. Consequently some labels may be substantially abbreviated. Users are
encouraged to consult the codebook when working with the dataset.

Offense Codes

The dataset includes many variables referring to offenses. The complete code labels for them are
included in Attachment A. Categorized offenses with code labels are included in variables V532,
V584, R234 and R236.

State vs Federal Facilities

The data for Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 1997, were originally
contained in separate files. Since these files contain the same variables and the same record
layouts, ICPSR concatenated them into two combined files, one for numeric data and one for
alphanumeric data. Variable V1959 – TYPE OF PRISON can be used to subset cases based on
whether the respondent was incarcerated in a State or Federal facility.

File Structure

The dataset is comprised of two raw data files, a machine-readable codebook, data collection
instruments, and SPSS and SAS data definition statements. The first data file, Numeric data,
includes the majority of the responses to the questionnaire items. It has 2,325 variables and a
logical record length of 5,756. The second data file, Alphanumeric data, includes all of the literal
responses including the "Other-specify" question responses. It has 347 variables and a logical


                                                                                               Page 23
record length of 13,071.

Confidentiality

To preserve respondent anonymity, the Bureau of Justice Statistics restricted certain identifying
variables from public dissemination. These variables are coded –9 and labelled "Blanked." The
original, unmasked data are available from the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data as a
private use file. Requests for such data must be submitted in writing, including specific reasons
for the request. All decisions regarding the release of data collections containing confidential data
are made by the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data. In addition, certain variables are not
available in either a public or private release. These variables are coded –9 and labelled "Blanked
Pub + Priv."

Dates

There are many date variables in this dataset. Dates which refer to a time period after the
interview are expressed with a four digit year. Dates prior to the interview are expressed using a
two digit year.

Users of the dataset are cautioned against simply computing time spans by subtracting one date
from another. Incorrect results are likely. Reviewing individual cases, frequency distributions, or
minimum values will reveal problematic date calculation, but only if the analyst actively searches
for theses problems. If the analyst does not search for these problems and instead goes directly
to a procedure where negative and positive values are mixed (such as a comparison of means), the
presence of negative or illogical ages or duration based on date calculations may not be revealed.
The potential errors range from negligible to substantial.

Analysts should review the format of the data variables they are working with. Two digit dates
can be easily recoded to four digits or new variables in four digit format can be computed.

h_PLEA                       Alford plea - A guilty plea to a charge
                             by the defendant, despite his claim of
                             innocence, because the evidence of guilt
                             is overwhelming. Usually the plea is to
                             a charge less than the original charge.
                             The defendant agrees to plead guilty
                             because he realizes that there is little
                             chance to win acquittal on the original
                             charge because of the strong evidence of
                             his guilt.

                             charge(s), but neither admits guilt nor

                                   Shotgun is a firearm intended to be shot
                                   from the shoulder with either a single- or
                                   double-barrel for firing shot (a concentration
                                   of small pellets) at short ranges.

                                   Semi-automatic gun is a firearm in which a
                                   shell is ejected and the next round of
                                   ammunition is loaded automatically from a
                                   magazine or clip. The trigger must be pulled
                                   for each shot. Semiautomatic guns should be
                                   classified as either handguns, rifles, or
                                   shotguns.

                                   Machine gun is an automatic gun which, if
                                   the trigger is held down, will fire rapidly and
                                   continuously. It is NOT a semi-automatic
                                   gun, for which the trigger must be pulled for
                                   each shot.

                                   Toy gun or BB gun - A BB gun shoots a
                                   single pellet, using air rather than an
                                   explosive to propel the pellet. Toy guns are
                                   not firearms.

                                   of small pellets) at short ranges.

                                   Sawed-off shotgun - A shotgun in which the
                                   barrel has been shortened or sawed off and is
                                   less than 18 inches in length. Any kind of
                                   shotgun can be sawed-off.

                                   part of the shotgun--a bolt, lever, or pump--
                                   to reload. A single shot shotgun must be
                                   loaded after each shot.

                                   Semiautomatic hunting-style shotgun - A
                                   shotgun in which a shell is ejected and the

                                   hunting-style shotgun. In addition, the
                                   shotgun has military features, such as a pistol
                                   grip, folding stock, and a detachable
                                   magazine or clip. It can be shot from the hip
                                   and looks like a semiautomatic military-style
                                   rifle.

                                      S7Q76c should read "Including yourself,

         Release Status

         CONDITIONAL Release - The release from a Federal, State or local correctional facility of an inmate who has
         not served his or her full sentence and whose freedom is contingent upon obeying specified rules of behavior.




Page 470
        ESCAPE - An offender on escape has fled from a prison, jail or other correctional facility without an official
        release from physical custody. Also, an offender on escape may fail to return to a correctional facility after
        authorized leave.

        PAROLE - An offender on parole was conditionally released from a prison by a parole board prior to
        completion of sentence. While on parole, the released offender is placed under the supervision of a parole
        agency and must obey all conditions set forth by the parole authority.

        PROBATION - An offender on probation is free as long as the person meets certain conditions of behavior. If
        the freedom is granted by a judicial officer, judge, or court, it is called probation from court. If the conditional
        release is granted after the offender has served time in a correctional facility, it is probation from prison.

        SHOCK PROBATION/SPLIT sentence - A sentence requiring the convicted person to serve a period of
        confinement in a local, state or federal facility followed by a period of probation. The term is often used for
        sentences to boot camp, followed by supervision in the community.

        CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - Buildings operated by a government agency or by contract with a
        government agency for the physical custody of sentenced persons or persons subject to criminal procedings.
        Correctional facilities include prisons, jails, juvenile facilities, detention centers, community based facilities
        such as pre-release centers and work-release facilities, and non-traditional facilities such as boot camps. It
        excludes lock-ups.

        SERVE TIME - Spend a period of time in a correctional facility because of a sentence. Does not refer to time
        in a correctional facility pending a trial or sentencing unless that time is later applied to the sentence.

             deceit. Any offense involving the illegal possesion, sale, distribution or use of money or property. General
             categories include arson, burglary, fraud, larceny, motor vehicle theft, stolen property, and theft.

    concentration of small pellets) at short ranges.

    Semi-automatic gun is a firearm in which a shell is ejected and the next round of ammunition is loaded
    automatically from a magazine or clip. The trigger must be pulled for each shot. Semiautomatic guns should be
    classified as either handguns, rifles, or shotguns.

    Machine gun is an automatic gun which, if the trigger is held down, will fire rapidly and continuously. It is NOT a
    semi-automatic gun, for which the trigger must be pulled for each shot.
